(The 3D Model of the PLCC chips is work of Zerover)

## WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS PROJECT IS NOT TESTED AND MISSING THINGS
This is not a functional item, it's only a exercice of reverse engineering to reinforce my skills in Kicad EDA Software.

* Use memory SIP-24 easy to found.
* No IC over IC
* small but in market battery socket
* 9V/5V jumpers for use with aurora or backplanes.
